# Executive Summary
The CDC, through its Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH), developed the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). The YRBSS conducts a biannual survey of middle and high school students to measure the risk behaviors students are engaged in. 

This analysis will use the 2017 US dataset to examine statistical differences between the overall student population and identified groups in the dataset.

# Motivation
I chose to examine this dataset because I believe that with data gathering and data analysis problems which have gone undetected or under addressed can be identified and appropriate resource can then be allocated to solving problems.

# MVP
My presentation highlights some of the significant differences between the identified groups in the dataset and the average response from a US high school student on the questionnaire. What is determined are that there are several areas which certain groups exhibit significantly higher response rates for risk behaviors than others.
